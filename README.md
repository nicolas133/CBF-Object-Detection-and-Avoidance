# Research Proposal: Control Barrier Function Safety Filter for PID Controllers

This research proposal aims to explore the use of a **Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety filter** to correct the output of traditional PID controllers. Additionally, it will investigate the integration of a safety filter with optimization-based approaches, particularly focusing on **Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs)**. The first part of the project is concerned with building a real-time safety filter using a CBF, in which LiDAR data is used to create the CBF.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Clustering the LiDAR Data**  
   Group the raw LiDAR data into meaningful clusters for further processing and analysis.

2. **Wrapping the LiDAR Data**  
   Enclose or approximate the clustered LiDAR data into a geometrical shape, such as a convex hull or bounding box.

3. **Creating a CBF (Control Barrier Function) from the Wrapped Shape**  
   Utilize the wrapped shape to construct a Control Barrier Function, which can be used for ensuring safe navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## Deliverables

- **Goal**: Static Obstacle Detection  
  Create a CBF from point cloud data from a static obstacle to penalize the output of the PID controller.

- **Stretch Goal**: Moving Obstacle Detection  
  Create a CBF from point cloud data from a moving obstacle to penalize the output of the PID controller.

- **Stretch Stretch Goal**: Multiple Agent CBF Obstacle Detection  
  Example: Two cars are given paths that overlap. Using LiDAR data or another technique, have the two agents build moving CBFs of each other and prevent collision while the paths overlap.

The ultimate goal of this project is to achieve autonomous navigation for an Ackermann steering vehicle, enabling it to autonomously navigate from point A to point B in a partially known environment. In this scenario, the vehicle may have access to a general map but lacks information about all potential obstacles, necessitating real-time detection and avoidance of new obstacles. This project is primarily concerned with the challenges of obstacle detection and avoidance in autonomous navigation rather than the complexities of path planning. The focus will be on addressing these challenges at the low-level controller stage rather than on the high-level pathfinding plans generated by heuristic and shortest-path algorithms like A* or Dijkstraâ€™s. The project will build on previous research in which an offline CBF safety filter was used to correct the PID controller output for both steering angle and velocity.
